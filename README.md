# Eddist 

Library of edit distance tools, implemented in Rust.

Edit distance tools are used to quantify the similarity between 2 strings, primarily by way of counting the number of insertions, removals or replacements (or transpositions), required to make 2 strings identical.

## Aim

To implement the most commonly used edit distance algorithms in Rust, including the likes of Hamming, Levenshtein, Damerau-Levenshtein distance metrics (and more).
